## Week 1

#### Two modes of thinking

* Focused mode: actively thinking about a problem.
* Diffuse mode: making connections.

#### Procrastination

Steps that lead to procrastination:

1. Unhappy/uneasy feeling.
1. Turn to a more pleasant task.
1. Uneasy feeling goes away.

Tactic: Pomodoro Technique

#### Practice

Practice makes permanent. Focus, then diffuse mode makes learning more permanent. Practicing a problem solidifies it in brain.

#### Memory

* Long-term memory.
* Working (short-term) memory.
  * Holds ~4 items.

Spaced Repetition: how to move something from working to long-term memory - work on it over a number of days.

## Week 2

### Chunking

Chunk = syntehsis of concepts into a "main idea". Create chunks by focused thinking, understanding by solving on your own, and practice. Then, learn context to know *when* to use each chunk.

Over time, creating a "library" of chunks is what creates expertise.

#### Recall

Read, then look away from material and see how much you can recall (and repeat). Recalling material in itself helps with deep learning.

Also recall material in differing physical settings.

#### Illusions of Competence

* Just looking at the solution to a problem is not enough, you must solve it again on your own.
* Don't over-highlight text.
* Mistakes when recalling is *good*.

Testing and recalling are much more effective than simply re-reading. Instead, deliberately practice.

#### Overlearning

**Deliberately practice** harder aspects or aspects you don't yet understand as well. Don't just go over material you already understand.

Einstellung: too trapped in one mode/rut of thinking.

**Interleaving**: skip around between different sections in a single study session (which is harder) to help understand *when* to use a technique, not just *how*. Creates creativity and flexibility in thinking.

## Week 3

### Procrastination

Doing the same amount of learning, but spaced out over time, instead of cramming, build more solid neural structures.

Procrastination = temporary relief from negative feelings, like addicition, but has bad long-term consequences.

Habit = energy saver, don't need to think about what you're doing:

1. Trigger/cue
1. Routine
1. Reward
1. Belief

It's normal to have negative feelings before starting on a studying task (even for a subject you normally enjoy). Non-procrasinators put aside those feelings, saying "you'll feel better once you get started".

Focus on *process* (e.g. spend 25 min on the assignment), not *product* (finish all 5 questions in the assignment).

Train yourself to let distractions (which *will* arise) pass by.

To change a habit, *all* you have to do is change your *reaction* (with a plan) to a *cue* that leads to a *reward*. Have belief that the new system works.

Keep a planner journal:

* Weekly list of key tasks
* Daily plan (write down the night before and remember to make them process-oriented if big)

Maintaining an active leisure time (and day's qutting time) is beneficial. And remember to "eat your frogs first" - start day immediately with hardest task.

### Memory

Humans have an outsized ability for visual and spatial memory.

## Week 4 (Recap)

\#1 Tip for learning: physical exercise.

Create lively visual metaphors or analogies to remember things.

Procrastination:

* Avoiding procrastination helps avoid cramming, which doesn't form solid neural structures.
* Can be a "keystone" bad habit.
* Shares characteristics with addiction (temporary relief for cravings, but long-term detriments).

Focus on *process not product*.

Create a *new habit* by rewiring an old habit.
