Coursera

## Week 1

There is value to being a "slow leaner": greater flexibility as long as you have *persistence*. Faster leaners must be careful of not adapting to new information.

*Active learning* (doing something yourself and testing yourself) is *much more effective* than *passive learning* (e.g. looking at worked-out solutions or tutorials). Testing yourself (as much as possible), working with others, and doing exercises are examples of active learning.

People who find breakthroughs: young people and people who switch careers/fields.

Mastery Learning: only moving on once you've mastered the previous material (vs. time-based progression).

*Focused* (active, receiving information) vs. *Diffuse* (passive) mode thinking. Mini disruptions, such as those that happen when studying in a coffee shop, can be helpful for learning big-picture ideas.

## Week 2 - Learning

### Meditation/Mindfulness

Meditation/Mindfulness can improve thinking and learning. Focused attention type meditation can help improve focused mode type thinking, and Open monitoring type meditation can help improve diffuse, imaginative thinking.

### Procrastination

During a Pomodoro: acknowldge distracting thought and just let it pass by. After 25 min, give yourself 5 min of a *different, rewarding* task.

Motivation to avoid procrastination comes from:

* Expectancy of reward (so: increase expectancy of success and certainty of reward)
* When you value the task and task is pleasant (incrase these)
  * E.g. by finding meaning (by connecting the task to your larger/life goals)
* Decrease impulsiveness

If overwhelmed, focus on getting *one thing* done and *keep track* of what works.


### Deliberate Practice

Despite recent trends, memorization is still important in learning. Balance "understanding" and memorization while learning.

Specifically, *Deliberate Practice* (focusing on the hardest bits) is very important.

### Stress

The *context* with which you view something is crucial. Nothing is is as important as you think it is in the moment.

Applying a *label* to your feelings/emotions allows you to think about them more rationally. Examples of distortions making things worse than they are:

* All or nothing thinking
* Magnification
* Over-generalization
* Mental filter
* Discounting the positive
* Jumping to conclusions
* Mind reading
* Emotional reasoning
* Should-y thinking
* Pejoratives (name calling)
* Personalization and blame

Think logically about your emotions/distortions and try to reframe negatives.

### Learning Styles

Try to take advantage of all typoes of learning styles (auditory, visual, kinesthetic, read/write).

### Social

The most effective teams have high levels of psychological safety. Seek out peers with high levels of empathy.

## Week 3 - Career

There are pushing and pulling influences from your passion, what the world needs, and the people around you. Need to balance these.

It's best to create deep skill in one area, while also *broadening* your passions (T-shaped). Can also create deep skills in two areas (pi-shaped).

Adding second skills are important and helpful to your existing skills.

General competence + selective ignorance.

Imposter syndrome can have a hidden benefit of making you more flexible to seeing/doing what you need to do to succeed. Persistence and flexibility are what matter most to success.

Career "catostrophes" (e.g. being fired/laid off) are never as bad as you think they are in the moment. Though it's not a good idea to stick in the same job for too long (risk of a getting into a rut and stagnating).

Reframe worrying: can allow you to analyze different possible scenarios (even if negative).

## Week 4

Physical exercise is the best way to grow new nuerons. Doing new/novel things every day helps grow brain as well. In brain terms, "if you don't use it, you lose it".

Good ideas: mentors, reading (including in unrelated subjects).
