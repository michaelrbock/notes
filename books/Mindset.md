# Notes

Print out this [diagram](http://www.doe.k12.de.us/cms/lib09/DE01922744/Centricity/Domain/240/Dweck%20Mind%20set%20poster.pdf) and place somewhere where you will see it every day.

Also write the following two sentences somewhere where you will see them every day, and ask yourself these questions every morning:

1. What are the opportunities for learning and growth today? For myself? For the people around me?
2. When, where, and *how* will I embark on my plan?

*How* is especially important to make sure you follow through on your plan.

> Instead of just giving employees an award for the smartest idea or praise for a brilliant performance, they would get praise for taking initiative, for seeing a difficult task through, for struggling and learning something new, for being undaunted by a setback, or for being open to and acting on criticism.

> However, sometimes an even tougher question is: Who can you turn to when good things happen?

> Your failures and misfortunes don’t threaten other people’s self-esteem. Ego-wise, it’s easy to be sympathetic to someone in need. It’s your assets and your successes that are problems for people who derive their self-esteem from being superior.

> vowing, even intense vowing, is often useless. The next day comes and the next day goes.

> What works is making a vivid, concrete plan

> For a long time, it’s frightening to think of giving up the idea of being superior.

> You begin to consider the idea that some people stand out because of their commitment and effort.

> Little by little you try putting more effort into things and seeing if you get more of the rewards you wanted. You do.

> Although you can slowly accept the idea that effort might be necessary, you still can’t accept that it’s no guarantee. It’s enough of an indignity to have to work at things, but to work and still not have them turn out the way you want—now, that’s really not fair. That means you could work hard and somebody else could still get the promotion. Outrageous.

> It’s a long time before you begin to enjoy putting in effort and a long time before you begin to think in terms of learning.

> Learning the nuts and bolts of the company could later give you a big advantage. All of our top growth-mindset CEOs knew their companies from top to bottom, inside out, and upside down.

> In the end, many people with the fixed mindset understand that their cloak of specialness was really a suit of armor they built to feel safe, strong, and worthy.

> We just want to be able to drop some pounds and keep them off. Or stop smoking. Or control our anger. Some people think about this in a fixed-mindset way. If you’re strong and have willpower, you can do it. But if you’re weak and don’t have willpower, you can’t. People who think this way may firmly resolve to do something, but they’ll take no special measures to make sure they succeed.

> The ones with the fixed-mindset thought: “If I have ability, I’ll do well; if I don’t, I won’t.” As a result, they didn’t use sophisticated strategies to help themselves.

> willpower is not just a thing you have or don’t have. Willpower needs help.

> Then there are the setbacks. They know that setbacks will happen. So instead of beating themselves up, they ask: “What can I learn from this? What will I do next time when I’m in this situation?” It’s a learning process—not a battle between the bad you and the good you.
